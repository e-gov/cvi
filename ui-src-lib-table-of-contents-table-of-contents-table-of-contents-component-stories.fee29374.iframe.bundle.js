But\n              at the same time I confess that at the back of my mind there lurked a hope\n              that stirring adventures might come my way. I had heard so much of the\n              place. Report had it that an earnest seeker after amusement might have a\n              tolerably spacious rag in this modern Byzantium. I thought that a few\n              weeks here might restore that keen edge to my nervous system which the\n              languor of the past term had in a measure blunted. I wished my visit to be\n              a tonic rather than a sedative. I anticipated that on my return the cry\n              would go round Cambridge, \'Psmith has been to New York.

The milk having been poured into the lid of a tobacco-tin, in\n              lieu of a saucer, she suspended her operations and adjourned for\n              refreshments.

"Not on your life, sonny," he said. "This stays right\n              here." He placed it carefully on the floor beside his chair, and proceeded to order dinner. </p>\n            <p> When the brother becomes the father, a suspicious death shall bring forth\n              bloodshed of blue blood and the return of monsters. </p>\n            <p>The day fire burns blue, the prophet shall cause an age of anarchy.</p>\n          </div>\n\n\n          <div cviNgToCSection="section-five">\n            <h1>Section Five</h1>\n            <p>Billy Windsor had started life twenty-five years before this story opens on his father\'s ranch in Wyoming. From there he had gone to a local paper of the type whose Society column consists of such items as "Pawnee Jim Williams was to town yesterday with a bunch of other cheap skates. We take this opportunity of once more informing Jim that he is a liar and a skunk," and whose editor works with a revolver on his desk and another in his hip-pocket. Graduating from this, he had proceeded to a reporter\'s post on a daily paper in a Kentucky town, where there were blood feuds and other Southern devices for preventing life from becoming dull. All this time New York, the magnet, had been tugging at him. All reporters dream of reaching New York. At last, after four years on the Kentucky paper, he had come East, minus the lobe of one ear and plus a long scar that ran diagonally across his left shoulder, and had worked without much success as a free-lance. He was tough and ready for anything that might come his way, but these things are a great deal a matter of luck. The cub-reporter cannot make a name for himself unless he is favoured by fortune. Things had not come Billy Windsor\'s way. His work had been confined to turning in reports of fires and small street accidents, which the various papers to which he supplied them cut down to a couple of inches.</p>\n            <p>This Pokemon is a ghost-type Pokemon and slightly resembles a toad.

I came over here principally, it is true,\n              to be at your side, should you be in any way persecuted by scoundrels. But\n              at the same time I confess that at the back of my mind there lurked a hope\n              that stirring adventures might come my way. I had heard so much of the\n              place. Report had it that an earnest seeker after amusement might have a\n              tolerably spacious rag in this modern Byzantium. I thought that a few\n              weeks here might restore that keen edge to my nervous system which the\n              languor of the past term had in a measure blunted. I wished my visit to be\n              a tonic rather than a sedative. I anticipated that on my return the cry\n              would go round Cambridge, \'Psmith has been to New York. He is full of\n              oats. For he on honey-dew hath fed, and drunk the milk of Paradise. He is\n              hot stuff. Rah!\' But what do we find?" </p>\n            <p> It shall be then, when rocks will rain from the sky, a man clad in green\n              shall bring forth a rise of faith. </p>\n            <p>The day fire burns blue, the prophet shall cause an age of anarchy.</p>\n            <p> By the time that Pugsy returned, carrying a five-cent bottle of milk, the\n              animal had vacated the book-shelf, and was sitting on the table, washing\n              her face. The milk having been poured into the lid of a tobacco-tin, in\n              lieu of a saucer, she suspended her operations and adjourned for\n              refreshments. Billy, business being business, turned again to Luella\n              Granville Waterman, but Pugsy, having no immediate duties on hand,\n              concentrated himself on the cat. </p>\n            <p> A waiter made an ingratiating gesture towards the basket, but the young\n              man stopped him. "Not on your life, sonny," he said. "This stays right\n              here." He placed it carefully on the floor beside his chair, and proceeded to order dinner. </p>\n            <p> When the brother becomes the father, a suspicious death shall bring forth\n              bloodshed of blue blood and the return of monsters. </p>\n            <p>The day fire burns blue, the prophet shall cause an age of anarchy.</p>\n          </div>\n\n\n          <div cviNgToCSection="section-five">\n            <h1>Section Five</h1>\n            <p>Billy Windsor had started life twenty-five years before this story opens on his father\'s ranch in Wyoming. From there he had gone to a local paper of the type whose Society column consists of such items as "Pawnee Jim Williams was to town yesterday with a bunch of other cheap skates. We take this opportunity of once more informing Jim that he is a liar and a skunk," and whose editor works with a revolver on his desk and another in his hip-pocket. Graduating from this, he had proceeded to a reporter\'s post on a daily paper in a Kentucky town, where there were blood feuds and other Southern devices for preventing life from becoming dull. All this time New York, the magnet, had been tugging at him. All reporters dream of reaching New York. At last, after four years on the Kentucky paper, he had come East, minus the lobe of one ear and plus a long scar that ran diagonally across his left shoulder, and had worked without much success as a free-lance. He was tough and ready for anything that might come his way, but these things are a great deal a matter of luck. The cub-reporter cannot make a name for himself unless he is favoured by fortune. Things had not come Billy Windsor\'s way. His work had been confined to turning in reports of fires and small street accidents, which the various papers to which he supplied them cut down to a couple of inches.</p>\n            <p>This Pokemon is a ghost-type Pokemon and slightly resembles a toad.

Psmith, sinking gracefully down beside it, stretched out his legs and lit a cigarette. Mike took one of the ordinary chairs; and Billy Windsor, planting himself in the rocker, began to rock rhythmically to and fro, a performance which he kept up untiringly all the time.</p>\n            <p>"Then let us stagger forth with Comrade Windsor.

If you could give me your undivided company, I should ask no more. But with you constantly away, mingling with the gay throng, it is imperative that I have some solid man to accompany me in my ramblings hither and thither.
