# Which tabs component to use?

In CVI there are two versions of tabs. Both versions have compatible API (props and nesting principles are the same). They also both make use of `TabComponent` as a child.

The new tabs are implemented by `TabsComponent`. It has a refreshed design, is mobile-friendly and on mobile replaces the tabs interface with a dropdown.

The older tabs are implemented by `TabGroupComponent`. It is not mobile-friendly, but still represents a full-fledged component. It is deprecated and meant to be gradually replaced by the new tabs, with not specific timeline set yet.
