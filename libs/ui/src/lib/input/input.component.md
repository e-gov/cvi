## Where to use

Displays a form input. Use with `FormItem` component.

Can be used with character counter directive `cviNgCharacterCounter`. If set, character counter uses binded `[maxChars]` property for defining maximum value, otherwise it takes the maximum value from `maxlength` attribute of the native HTML element. If neither is set, character counter is not displayed. Sets the `maxlength` value accordingly.
