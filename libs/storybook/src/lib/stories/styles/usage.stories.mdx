# Using the library styles

The library offers Sass and CSS variables, Sass components, and utility classes and mixins. All of those should be easy to use in your project.

Some of the components also provide an occasional CSS variable that allows to override its styles from outside.

## Variables

In the library you can find a huge range of Sass and CSS variables and presentational Sass functions that mirror design tokens of the design system. See [Variables Overview](?path=/docs/styles-available-variables-overview--page) page for more details.

## Components

All Sass components use the same structure and are found in [`src/lib/scss/components` folder](https://github.com/e-gov/cvi/tree/main/libs/styles/src/lib/scss/components). To employ a Sass component in your code, `include` a component mixin to a class of your choice:

```scss
.myapp-alert {
  @include cvi-notification;
}
```

Ensure that classes in your HTML correspond to the class names defined in the mixin (prefixed with `__` or `--`). A part before the prefix would use the name of your own class. Eg. an JSX example would look like this:

```jsx
<div class="myapp-alert myapp-alert--severity-warning">
   <h2 class="myapp-alert__title">{title}</h2>
   <h2 class="myapp-alert__content">{content}</h2>
</div>
```

In your app you can assign classes prefixed with `--` to props of a Javascript component.

You can also explore [code of Angular components](https://github.com/e-gov/cvi/tree/main/libs/ui/src/lib) published as a part of this library as an example.

## Utility classes and mixins

Some often-used utility classes and Sass mixins are also available in the library. See all [the mixins in `lib/scss/settings/_mixins.scss`](https://github.com/e-gov/cvi/blob/main/libs/styles/src/lib/scss/settings/_mixins.scss) and [the utility classes in `lib/scss/settings/_utility-classes.scss`](https://github.com/e-gov/cvi/blob/main/libs/styles/src/lib/scss/settings/_utility-classes.scss).
