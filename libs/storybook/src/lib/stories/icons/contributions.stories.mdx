# Adding icons to CVI

Adding an icon to the library is simple.

To add an icon with a file name of `my-icon-name.svg`:

1. drop the icon file in SVG format into `/libs/icons/src/lib/svg` folder;
2. run `npm run generate-icons`;
3. (optional) import the icon to `ui.module.ts` as `cviMyIconName` if you intend to use it inside of this library.

The new icon can be added to your app with `cvi-ng-icon` component using `name` prop in `my_icon_name` format.

Make sure that the SVG code of the icon is cleaned and optimised for recoloring. Make sure the icon:

1. doesn't contain internal CSS;
2. doesn't contain any classes (a class added to the svg tag itself is allowed);
3. doesn't have `fill`/`stroke` attributes (colors are expected to be set in CSS outside of the icon);
4. doesn't have `width`/`height` attributes;
5. ...is a proper icon and not a logo or an illustration.

Icons are automatically linted with [SVGLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svglint).
