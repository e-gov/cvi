# Welcome to the e-Gov CVI UI library!

These Storybook docs contain detailed information on how to install and use CVI.

The implementations include a shared CSS library (preprocessed with Sass) and HTML examples based on it, as well a UI kit in Angular, a UI kit in React and a typed icon library.

Please choose an item you need in the sidebar to the left (press `S` if you don't see it).

CVI UI library is a neverending work in progress that welcomes any feedback and becomes better thanks to you, its users.

The project source code is located [here](https://github.com/e-gov/cvi).
