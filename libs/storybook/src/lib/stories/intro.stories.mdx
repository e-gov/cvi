# Welcome to CVI UI library!

These friendly docs contain detailed information on how to install and use implementations of [Veera Design System](https://veera.eesti.ee) in code.
These implementations are not part of the official Veera Design System.

The implementations include a shared CSS library (preprocessed with Sass) and HTML examples based on it, as well as a UI kit in Angular and a typed icon library.

Please choose an item you need in the sidebar to the left (press `S` if you don't see it).

CVI UI library is a neverending work in progress that welcomes any feedback and becomes better thanks to you, its users.

The project source code is located [here](https://github.com/e-gov/cvi).
